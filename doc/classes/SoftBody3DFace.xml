		A triangular face consisting in a 3D soft body simulation.
	</brief_description>
	<description>
		Defines a face in a 3D soft body simulation. Wind forces and the body's internal pressure may operate on its faces, although there is some variation in how this is implemented by each physics server.
		[member SoftBody3DSettings.auto_constraint_settings] can also be used to automatically create edge constraints from the defined faces.

			The indices of the three vertices that this constraint affects.
			A clockwise [url=https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-OpenGL/Face-culling]winding order[/url] is used to specify the outside vs the inside of the face, which may affect the simulation of the body's internal pressure on the face.
